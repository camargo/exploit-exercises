# [Level08](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level08/)

Open up `capture.pcap` in Wireshark and "Follow the TCP Stream" of the first packet:

![Level08-0](https://github.com/camargo/exploit-exercises/blob/master/nebula/images/Level08-0.png)

The trick here is the `.` characters in the password. Inspecting the hex we see `'.' -> 0x7f`:

![Level08-1](https://github.com/camargo/exploit-exercises/blob/master/nebula/images/Level08-1.png)

This turns out to be the [delete character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_character), which gives the password `backd00Rmate`. Log into the `flag08` account and do `getflag`.
