# [Level14]()

If you do some encryption queries like so:

```bash
echo "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" | ./flag14 -e
-> 0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^9
```

You notice that each character in the output is just the ASCII decimal of the input at the same index, plus the value of the current index in the string.
From there it's easy to write a decryption script doing the opposite (i.e. subtracting instead of adding):

```python
x = "857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW."
y = ""

for i in range(len(x)):
    y += chr(ord(x[i]) - i)

print(y)
```

This should give the password `8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165`. Log into the `flag14` account and do:

```bash
getflag
```
