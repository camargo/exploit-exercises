# [Level06](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/level06/)

For this exercise I used [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/) to crack a plain-text password hash from `/etc/passwd`. 

On the `level06` account I did:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06 > password
```

I moved the `password` file to an attacker machine with `john` installed and did:

```bash
john password --show
```

I logged into the `flag06` account with the password and did:

```bash
getflag
```
